# Data Structure Practice

Welcome to the Data Structure Practice repository! This repository is designed to help you sharpen your data structure skills through simple and short coding challenges and exercises.

## Getting Started

To get started with practicing data structure problems, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this repository to create your copy.

2. **Clone the repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structure-practice.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

3. **Choose a problem**: Browse through the `problems` directory to find a data structure problem that interests you. Each problem is in its own folder and contains a README file describing the problem.

4. **Solve the problem**: Create a new file in the problem's folder and implement your solution. Make sure to provide a clear and concise explanation of your approach.

5. **Test your solution**: Use the sample inputs provided in the problem's README to test your solution's correctness and efficiency.

6. **Contribute (Optional)**: If you want to contribute your solutions or add new problems, create a pull request to the main repository.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
data-structure-practice/
├── problems/
│   ├── problem1/
│   │   └── solution.py
│   ├── problem2/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── solution.py
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

The `problems` directory contains subdirectories, each representing a different data structure problem. Inside each problem's folder, you will find a `README.md` file that describes the problem and provides sample inputs and outputs. You can use the provided starter code files (e.g., `solution.py` or `solution.java`) to write your solutions.
